## Opportunity

The app addresses the accessibility issue in immersive conversational language practice and improves upon existing solutions by offering:

- Easy scheduling and low activation energy without the need to develop relationships as in language partner matching platforms.
- More cost-effective and tailored approach compared to chat-centered applications.

## Next Steps

- Development of visionOS App.
- Release of free version and development of premium/group tiers.
- Expand user base and partner with educational institutions.
- Broaden language offerings and market reach.
